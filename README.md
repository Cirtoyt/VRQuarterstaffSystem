# VRQuarterstaffSystem
A two handed Quarterstaff system for implementing into a VR Game.

Hi all that find their way here, this was a large university project I ran over a year's length in my final year of an undergraduate degree in Games Technology.
I tasked myself in researching and developing a custom two-handed melee combat system for VR user experiences.
Ultimately this led me to publishing my findings within a summary video that you can find below, as well as a full dissertation-style report that covers the implementation, how it all works, how I got there, and what could be done further for anyone interested in taking my original work further.
I, myself will be moving onto new VR challenges, lately more magical ones, and will most definitely return to this in the futre, but probably in another project, that may even be commercially available!
